%% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
%% This diagram shows the sequence of interactions for a RAG query.
%% Direct icon embedding in participant names is less standard and
%% might not render well or be supported in all Mermaid environments.
%% Using an alias with an <img> tag *might* work in some renderers,
%% but is often omitted for clarity in sequence diagrams.
%% Example of potential HTML in participant (might not render well):
%%   participant CR as "<img src='URL_TO_GCP_CLOUD_RUN_ICON.svg' width='20'><br>Cloud Run RAG App"
