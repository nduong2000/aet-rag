In the past, the NY HCRA payment was on a separate segment so the Data Warehouse (and Universal Files) were able to report on the specific NY HCRA payments (not Graduate Medical Education payments or GME) using provider TIN/PIN combinations. In the claim system, processing the NY HCRA amount to a separate segment was a manual, complicated process and has since been automated.\nWith the automation of the NY HCRA processing, the NY HCRA payment is on a single claim segment along with the payment to the provider. In the online claim system, the separate payments to the provider and NY HCRA are identified, but on the downstream data in the data warehouse (and the Universal File) the amounts were not separately identified.\nWith the addition of the Total Surcharge Amount, it can be determined how much of the\nPaid Amount was associated with a surcharge.\nHypothetical example (a very simple example in which a bill is paid at 100%):\nRegular hospital bill = $1,500\nHospital bill with applicable surcharge amount: let's say it was $1,500 \u00d7 1.0885 =\n$1,632.75\nAllowed/Covered = $1,632.75 (modified during claim processing, see note below)\nPaid Amount = $1632.75\nThe Paid Amount on the claim is $1,632.75 and is reported in Field #100, Paid Amount.\nThe NY HCRA Surcharge Amount is $132.75 and will be reported in the Total Surcharge Amount, Field #137 (this amount is also included in Paid Amount, Field #100).\nNote:  The claim still balances from Allowed to Paid with the addition of the surcharge amount to the Paid Amount field because during claim processing the Allowed Amount is modified to include both the Negotiated Rate and the NY HCRA Tax Amount (which in turn understates Aetna's discounts) in the downstream data warehouse and data files.\nNote:  This field is only populated for claims processed on the ACAS claim adjudication system."

This template is applicable to non-ACAS claim records and ACAS claim records including the type of Aetna Health Fund claim records where the Fund payments do NOT reduce Deductible Amounts.\nThis explanation only applies to fee-for-service claim records and do not apply to encounter records.\nIn addition, please note that this is a theoretical explanation.  Sometimes the elements of claim adjudication do not balance to these templates, as a result of special plan designs or other considerations.  For example, not all of the referenced financial fields are available or are not 100% reliable for non-ACAS data records.  This is because the non-ACAS claim system platform doesn't capture these data elements.  As a result, these financial amounts had to be approximated.\n\"TOP DOWN\" DOLLAR EXPLANATION \u2013 AHF:  This template is unique to Aetna Health Fund claim records where the plan design specifies that Fund payments reduce Deductible and/or Coinsurance Amounts.\nThis AHF financial step-down is intended as a guideline which will work for the claim data of many plan sponsors; however, there are variations in the administration of AHF for some plan sponsors. Accordingly, these guidelines will not work for all plan sponsors. If you encounter a situation where the AHF financial step-down is not working for you, send the details (preferably including sample records) to the same Regional mailbox that the original file request was sent to, and we will assist you in resolving any questions.\nAetna Health Fund claim records warrant a separate top-down template, because these claims include data fields that are not populated in standard fee-for-service claims.  The recipient of a Universal Medical/Dental File may need to contact Aetna's Account Manager or Aetna Informatics to determine for a given plan sponsor exactly how Deductible/Coinsurance Amounts were updated (i.e., in an online or off-line mode) and if the fund pays first or if the fund covers member out of pocket amounts.\nACAS Adjustments:   There are two ways in which claims may be adjusted in Aetna's ACAS claim engine (Field #7, Source System Platform = \u201827\u2019):"
